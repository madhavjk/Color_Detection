# ***Color Detection***

**Project's Brief Details:**  In this color detection Python project, the aim is to build an application through which you can automatically get the name of the color by clicking on them in the picture. So for this, we will have a data file that contains the color name and its values. Then we will calculate the distance from each color and find the shortest one.

1.  Clone the repository locally on your pc.
         
         git clone <url>
  
2.  Extract and open the cloned folder in IDE.

        cd Regex_Color_Detection

3.  Install the required dependencies
        
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        
4.  Run the script
        
        python color.py --image colorpic.jpg
        
5.  Now, double-click anywhere on the image and you will get color and pixel value of the point.
